    To scrape images and videos from a website, you can use Python with the help of libraries like BeautifulSoup
  for parsing the HTML content and requests to fetch the web page's content. For scraping videos, you might need to
  extract links to video files, and for images, you can collect the image URLs.<br>
  
  Here's a basic example to get you started:
Replace 'https://example.com' with the URL of the website you want to scrape. This code will find and download images and
  videos from that website. Keep in mind that scraping websites should be done responsibly and ethically, respecting the 
  website's terms of service and copyright laws. Additionally, websites may have various techniques to prevent scraping,
  so make sure you have the necessary permissions before scraping a website.
